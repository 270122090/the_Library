MEMBERS:
- needs to have option to add address

- when searching for member, maybe have their address instead of phone number as identifier
  bc it'll save time in exchanging details n young kids usually don't have phones.

- when editting member, all details show be able to be modified bc people get married, 
  move, upgrade phones & get annoyed at reminders. Print their details but maybe make an option 
  where you can still retype if needed.
